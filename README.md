# Pega Technical Assessment

**User Story** 
- It must be a single page application
- The main application has a ribbon that can be expanded - collapsed on hover – being able to tweak the animations and to make it look like the design is important
- Clicking on the + icon will expand a menu of options allowing to create new objects (Bug, epic) and navigate to a new page
- The ribbon also contains some landing pages that can be clicked - for this implementation, having the bugs and epics landing pages is fine
- Click on the landing pages should update the browser url but should update the UI without navigating top (e.g SPA architecture)
- Should support Chrome, FF and Safari
- For the icons and images, you can use any of your choice - it does not have to match exactly the video - same applies for colors, font.
- Should try to make it as 508 compliant as possible including support for keyboard.
- The focus should be on the ribbon and the interaction – the content of the pages is not important
